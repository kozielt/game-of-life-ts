# Conway's Game of Life

### Overview

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in React. 

### Why
I created this project mostly for practice and to try out a couple of things:
- **React + TypeScript** - There's a lot of positive *vibration* in the community about using both of them together. Until now I only had occasion to work on *Node* and *React Native* projects written in *TypeScript*. I was curious what will be my developer experience compared to regular *Java Script*.  
- **useReducer as a global state** - Use *useReducer* instead of *Redux* as a global state management solution
- **Create React App** - Until now I was always using custom tooling configs (webpack, babel, eslint, etc.), but me colleague persuaded my to try *Create React App*.  

### How to run it locally
I'm using yarn as a package manager, so you need to type: 

```bash
$ yarn && yarn start 
```
